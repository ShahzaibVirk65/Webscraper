Customizing for Your Website
----------------------------

Modify the `Scraper` class to adapt to the structure of your target website:

-   **Headlines**: Adjust the selector in `article.select("h1, h2, h3")`.
-   **Links**: Customize the link selector in `article.select("a").attr("href")`.
-   **Summaries**: Modify the paragraph selector in `article.select("p")`.

For example, if your target site has headlines inside `<h3>` tags and summaries in `<div class="summary">`:

```
String headline = article.select("h3").text();
String summary = article.select("div.summary").text();

```

* * * * *

Example Output
--------------

```
Scraping complete for URL: https://example.com
Title: Example Website
Headline: Breaking News Today
Link: https://example.com/article
Summary: This is a brief summary of the article.

```

* * * * *

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Common Issues:

1.  **Connection Timeout**: Ensure the website is reachable and not blocking bots.
    -   Use a custom User-Agent in `Jsoup.connect`:

        ```
        Jsoup.connect(url).userAgent("Mozilla/5.0").timeout(10000).get();

        ```

2.  **Maven Not Recognized**: Add Maven to your system PATH.
    -   [Set Up Maven on Windows](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
    -   [Set Up Maven on Linux](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
